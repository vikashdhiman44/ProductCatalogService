If we have specified `select` mode, it will be used to get data. FetchType will be honored it is.

In scenarios, where we are asking for asking for one category, it will not run any subquery
because that case can be handled using simple select.


If fetchmode is join, fetchtype doesn't get honored.

If fetchmode is select or subselect, then fetchtype actually works.


BOTH ARE SOLUTIONS TO N+1 PROBLEM

        FETCHMODE - SUBSELECT

Hibernate: select c1_0.id,c1_0.created_at,c1_0.description,c1_0.last_updated_at,c1_0.name
,c1_0.state from category c1_0

Hibernate: select p1_0.category_id,p1_0.id,p1_0.amount,p1_0.created_at,p1_0.description,
p1_0.image_url,p1_0.is_prime_specific,p1_0.last_updated_at,p1_0.state,p1_0.title
from product p1_0 where p1_0.category_id in (select c1_0.id from category c1_0)


      BATCHSIZE = 2 ((n/size)+1) WITH FETCH MODE - SELECT

Hibernate: select c1_0.id,c1_0.created_at,c1_0.description,c1_0.last_updated_at,
c1_0.name,c1_0.state from category c1_0

Hibernate: select p1_0.category_id,p1_0.id,p1_0.amount,p1_0.created_at,p1_0.description,
p1_0.image_url,p1_0.is_prime_specific,p1_0.last_updated_at,p1_0.state,p1_0.title from
product p1_0 where p1_0.category_id in (?,?)
